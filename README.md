# AP Studio Art Project

I was inspired by Islamic Art's focus on math for creation. Since it is forbidden by islamic law to make realistic works of art, geometric and arithmetic based art took precedence. 

I decided to use desmos to explore this style of art, as its graphing function would easily allow me to do repeated patterns

The only issue was that... the desmos color palette is ugly and I could not change it

Well, I took to the internet and the Desmos API let me both stylize my graph with default settings as well as set a color palette. How wonderful!

Here is the Desmos-only version:

And here is the version where I went into Adobe Illustrator and violated the pattern:
